This project was made for **SteelHacks 2024**, a 24-hour hackathon hosted by The University of Pittsburgh's Computer Science Club.

We worked on the “Beginner” and “Pitt Inspired Demo powered by Gemini API” tracks.

This project is a study group planner that takes in user’s information such as name, interests, and courses and then outputs a recommended study group.

The program starts at our front-end website, which utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where Pitt students can make an account with information that includes their name, major, graduation year, and current course list. Then, it is sent to the backend where Python receives that data and sends that along with several SQL files to be read by Google’s Gemini API that helps decide which other students the current student would pair with best based on their coursework and interests.  The website has multiple pages such as a profile that accepts a photo, home, and results.

We have a Python Student class, created as a guide and formerly used to store data.

We envision this project helping new freshmen and transfer students find a potential friend group of people who share coursework and interests.
